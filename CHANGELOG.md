## [v1.0.9] - 2024-10-03
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where running the script `renew_all_item_types.py` cleared the attribute information of item types. Added a tool, `replace_item_type_data.py`, to restore the cleared data to a specified date and time.
- Modified the error message "Item already DELIETED in the system" on the import screen to be displayed in Japanese.
